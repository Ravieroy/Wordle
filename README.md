## Wordle

### A python implementation for wordle solving.

This is a python implementation of solving wordle which is available [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and the older puzzles are archived [here](https://www.devangthakkar.com/wordle_archive/?1)

The word list is taken from [here](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html) which is in public domain. This also contains a jupyter notebook with slightly more detailed explanations than the actual code.

### How to use

The code was written in python 3.8.10 and should work in anything above 3.6.X. Simply do `python3 solve_wordle` and follow the onscreen instructions. Ofcourse you need to know the rules and your own discertion is required. A little bit of luck is also needed. Feel free to use the code and improve it.
